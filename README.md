Comprehensive MySQL Database Project for managing a Smart Home (Sistema Domotico) environment. This project covers the full database lifecycle, from defining a robust relational schema with complex constraints to implementing advanced stored procedures and analytical routines for optimizing energy consumption and improving occupant comfort.

The system is defined entirely through SQL, including DDL, DML, Triggers, and Stored Procedures.

It includes a full documentation, and two versions of Entity Relationship diagram (one is more conceptual and the other one is more low-level). These documents are in Italian.
